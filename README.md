# FireAlarm_Sensor_Blynk_Call
This project is one of subjects at my university and relates to IoT. 
The system uses 2 sensors (fire sensor and gas sensor) to collect data from the environment. 
If data exceeds the threshold, ESP8266 will send data to app Blynk for notification, Arduino UNO communicates with Module SIM800L to make a call to user, led and buzzer are actived at the same time.
